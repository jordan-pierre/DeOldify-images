# DeOldify-images

Public repo for my personal photos for [DeOldify by Jantic](https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify#example-images).

Their notebook requires publicly available photos and suggest sites Imagur, but storing them here is more convenient.

I used it to color some old images my grandparents had.
